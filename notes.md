# First week
## Create a snapshot
- Create a snapshot about the project by combining the views of team members with the views of the upper management and your own observation.
- Have an observation on the team on the first day of work, their performace, team work, their tech stack, what you think can be improve...
- Have meetings with each team member first and ask about the project
  - Challenges
  - Things to improve
  - Are they clear about the objectives?
  - Enthusiasm? 
  - Are they clear about who is responsible for certain decisions? Are they clear about the road map?
- Meet team member individually.
- Have meetings with the upper managemenet and ask the same thing about their perspective about the projects:
  - Challenges
  - The performance of the team, who is the best, who is the worst
  - How long have they been doing it? Has it changed much?
  - General advice
- Combine the views of the team and the upper management to see the differences
  - Do they come from miscommunication upward and downward?
  - False beliefs, the team and the management believe in different things so the view the project differently
- Are they happy? Excitied to show up for work?
- What do they have in common with each other?

## Make an action list
- Items to talk with the team:
  - Why the communication is poor
  - Why the expectations are different
  - Why the work quality is not high (low output, many bugs...)
- Items to talk with the management:
  - Why the communication is poor
  - Why the management is not aware of team's problems like understaffed, challenges, unclear about the objectives

# Manage yourself first
## Get organized
### Use calendar
- Use calendar to book meetings with teams and other people
- Use to check today meetings
- Blocks of time to prevent other people from booking over them, so you have time to do your own things.
### Use To-do list
- To note down the things you have to do when the ideas come
- Use to organize all tasks.
- Check to-do list at the beginning and the end of the day
### Email
- Set up rules to redirect important and unimportant emails
### Keep a note
- Keep a note to write down things in details
- To note down a conversation with a team member or an idea.

## Categorize your activities
### Information gathering
- The information you hold is what you base your decisions on
- Gathering information is not a formal process but can happen anywhere, even at the coffee machine in a conversion with a colleague
- Keep adding new information, seeking out, ask questions. The desire to gather information will also motivate you to talk to people and make you an effective manager
### Decision making
- Take decision making seriously, not everyone has this power and it can have extrapolited effects later on
- Every decision is an inflection point, who should we hire, should we split the team into sub team.
### Nudging
- You can contribute our opinions in conversations to influence the decisions even if you're not the decision maker
- Nudging can happen anywhere anytime.
- You are a manager so your opinions carry some authority, so bear it in mind when you offer your opinions freely.
### Being a role model
- A manager need to show the team they can walk the walk and talk the talk.
- Lead by example
- Be involved in day to day discussions and contribute technically if you can
- Demonstrate the quality that you want your team to have

## Measure your productivity
- You're responsible for your team's output, if they're not able to perform well, it's your job to fix it
- Your team's output is more important that your output
- You also work through those outside of your team that you influence

# Working with individuals
## Interfacing with humans
- What language and communication style you should use to discuss, debate and deliver feedback openly and candidly
- What API to use to delegate work through others 

### How to communicate well?
- Think about the medium to use to communicate
  - Face to face: requires present in person. Best for important conversations like performance review 
  - Email: fairly formal, archives information to refer back to
  - Documents: formalizing ideas such as designs and architectures
  - Chat: great to communicate in teams to ask quick questions, not always a good place for formal conversation.
- Ensure each piece of communication if fully formed. There is a big difference between these 2
  - ***Hello***
  - ***Hello, are you around today?\
  I'm looking for some help with testing my API change locally.***

### Manage your energy
- If you don't bring the right energy to a conversation, you may make the person think that you're annoyed at them while you are just annoyed by the last convesation with someone else
- You can deal with bad energy in 2 ways
  - Tell the person that you're speaking up front, and the reason why
  - Reschedule the meeting

### Measure twice, cut once
- Only communicate with the team when need to, not when want to
- If a news is not confirmed then it's best that your team doesn't need to know
- A manager's communication should never be to increase their social capital but to be concise, informative and actionable

### Make the conversations about the others
- A conversation is between 2 parties but you should always make it about the others, not about you
- Before sending an email, reread it as if you're reading it the first time to put yourself in others' shoes.

### Make conversations 2 ways
- Connect at a human level with the person you're communicating with
- Be natural and inquisitive, listen, ask questions and invite responses

### Be consistent
- Be consistent with the way you communicate across different platforms and mediums
- The formality doesn't have to be consistent though such as in chat, you can start with formality and gradually ease the formality to a place that you're comfortable with that allows you to still be authorative and critical when needed
- Once you reach extreme informality, it's very difficult to get back to formality.

### How to give feedback?
- When delivering feedback, need to ensure that you:
  - Care personally about the person you're talking to and it's in their best interest and you want to see them improve
  - Cut to the chase, if you think something is not good enough then say it.
- If you don't do 1 of these 2 or neither of them then one of these things can happen
  - *Ruinous empathy*: when you care personally but too afraid to challenge directly and the person cannot improve
  - *Obnoxious aggression*: when you only challenge but don't care personally and turn the feedback into mean criticsm
  - *Manipulative insencirity*: when you do neither so good behaviors go unpraised and bad behaviors are ignored
- However if you do both of those things then you achieve *Radical candor*, which is when you directly deliver the feedback in such a way that the person sees that you care

### Traits to avoid
- *Overcommunication*: if you have to repeat what you said again and again that can frutstrates other people then the communication is not efficient
- *Waffling*: don't avoid a question by directing to something else, if you don't want to answer a question or don't know the answer then just say no
- *Playing with the crowd*: don't be a manager who try to please everyone, especially when it means hiding information, sugar coating or lying, just say it like it is, even if it's bad news
- *Inconsistency*: be the same person to everyone.
- *Letting emotions get in the way*: if you feel you're angry or overcharged with emotions then be open about how you feel or reschedule the meetings.
